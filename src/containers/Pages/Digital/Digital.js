             At Dataset, we believe that organizations strive to delight their customers.  With this in mind, our approach to Digital begins with an outside â€“ in lens.  Through this approach, we look at how an organization deals with its customers and offers its products or services. This could also include partners, resellers, etc., but our focus here is the top-line growth. </AboutText>

          Digital is not a project; it is a continuous organizational program. There is no right or wrong answer as to where an organization is on its Digital Maturity curve. Technology and Use Cases evolve constantly; you just need to get started. A Digital Maturity Assessment is a good place to start to identify your highest priority Use Cases. </AboutText>
